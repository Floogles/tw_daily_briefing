# tw_daily_briefing
A script that takes the Week Daily Briefing every day and sends a podcast of it to specified email addresses. I have checked the robots.txt file of the website and it does not exclude scraping the page in this manner. Note any products made by this code do not belong to the creator - whilst the code is mine the content of the podcast belong to The Week.

In the code, email addresses of recipients of the podcast have been removed, as have the details of the email account that sends them to protect from abuse.
